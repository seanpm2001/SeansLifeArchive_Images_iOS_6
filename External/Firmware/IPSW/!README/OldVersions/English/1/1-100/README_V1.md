## About

IPSW.me is my current source for Apple firmware (despite not owning any current Apple products) if [this site](https://ipsw.me/) isn't providing the actual operating system image, then I may just be hoarding over 1.1 terabytes of firmware data.

Can I use this firmware as a source of booting an iOS virtual machine, or is that not what it is for? I do not know
