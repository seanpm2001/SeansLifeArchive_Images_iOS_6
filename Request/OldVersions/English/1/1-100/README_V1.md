# A request

## Context

I used to have an iPod Touch (5th generation) with iOS 6 from 2012 to 2015. I came to love the look of iOS, and later on in my life, I gained a heavy amount of nostalgia for it.

### Virtualization

In 2018, I got into virtualization. As of 2021, I have not been able to find a functional disk or system image of any version of iPhoneOS or iOS. I have found system images for every other operating system (except for video game console operating systems) I would really love to be able to try and get an iOS 6 virtual machine running, and to start research on virtualizing iOS if it hasn't already been done.

## Request

If anyone knows how to do this, or where there is a source is to obtain a digital copy of any version of iOS (iOS 6 and below) please let me know.
