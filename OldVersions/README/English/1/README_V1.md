# SeansLifeArchive_Images_iOS_6
The module for my life story project that contains my iOS 6 images. 

***

## About

See above. This repository is an archive of my iOS 6 images, an operating system by Apple Inc. in 2012 that I favorite in terms of user interface.

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

## Request

This is my main request regarding iOS.

### Context

I used to have an iPod Touch (5th generation) with iOS 6 from 2012 to 2015. I came to love the look of iOS, and later on in my life, I gained a heavy amount of nostalgia for it.

#### Virtualization

In 2018, I got into virtualization. As of 2021, I have not been able to find a functional disk or system image of any version of iPhoneOS or iOS. I have found system images for every other operating system (except for video game console operating systems) I would really love to be able to try and get an iOS 6 virtual machine running, and to start research on virtualizing iOS if it hasn't already been done.

## The request

If anyone knows how to do this, or where there is a source is to obtain a digital copy of any version of iOS (iOS 6 and below) please let me know.
